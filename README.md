# LAN Server Properties
For Minecraft 1.12.2â€“1.18.2, Forge and Fabric.
This branch supports both 1.18.1 and 1.18.2.

When this mod is installed, it enhances the vanilla Minecraft "Open to LAN" screen, which now also:
* Allows for a port customization.
* Allows a user to disable PvP.
* Allows a user to disable the online mode, so that also unauthenticated players can join the LAN server.
* Allows editing server configuration from the same "Open to LAN" button after the server is published.

## Note
* This mod is client-only, installing on a dedicated server will not affact anything.
* Only the Lan server owner need to install this mod.
* Installing this mod does not prevent you from joining other vanilla or mod servers.

## Dependencies
### Forge Version
You need to install Forge and then install this mod.

### Fabric Version
You need to install Fabric Loader and then install this mod. Fabric API is optional but highly recommended.

## For developers
To modify and debug the code, first import the "forge" or "fabric" folder as a Gradle project in Eclipse IDE, and then run the gradle task `genEclipseRuns`.

Windows users need to replace `./` and `../` with `.\` and `..\`, respectively.

Since 1.17.1, LSP for Fabric and Forge share common code as much as possible. The shared code base uses Minecraft official mapping.
